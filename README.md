# PSY_7500_Final
Final project repository for PSY 7500: Macro-Sector Resume Analysis using NLP

This repository includes the data file, data scraping code, and cleaning and analytic code used to analyze resume text data. This project analyzes how key terms in resumes differ among the six career cluster groups of the National Career Cluster Framework. I define two macro-sectors using the Framework's cluster groups and the literature on occupational sectors; I estimate logistic regression models using maachine learning techniques to understand the extent to which key terms in resumes differentiate between the two macro-sectors.

Resume data used in this project are publicly available. They can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset); code used to scrape the resumes is available [here](https://github.com/Sbhawal/resumeScraper/tree/master).
