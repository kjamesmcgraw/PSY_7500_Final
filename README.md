# PSY_7500_Final
Final project repository for PSY 7500: Macro-Sector Resume Analysis using NLP

This repository includes links to the data, data scraping code, and cleaning and analytic code used to analyze resume text data. This project analyzes how key terms in resumes differ among the six career cluster groups of the National Career Cluster Framework. I define two macro-sectors using the Framework and the literature on occupational sectors and estimate logistic regression models using maachine learning techniques to understand the extent to which key terms in terumes differentiate between two maacro-sectors.

Resume data used in this project are publicly available. They can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset); code used to scrape the resumes is available ([here](https://github.com/Sbhawal/resumeScraper/tree/master)).
